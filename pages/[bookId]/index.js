Quite literally, in the case of this cover, which shows Harry underwater, braving Hogwarts’ Great Lake. The scene is taken from the Triwizard Tournament, which serves as the main vein of this book’s plot – focusing on Harry’s second task as a reluctant Hogwarts champion. The mysterious greens and blues of this cover encapsulate the enigmatic atmosphere of Harry’s underwater mission. And eagle-eyed Harry Potter fans may spot some fun details in the background!'
